Minimal Wi-Fi Monitor is a set of four BASH tools to deal with faulty Internet connections that drop while being nominally up.
Minimal Network Monitor just monitors the Internet connection and logs the public IP address.
Minimal Network Monitor from Startup does the same, but output is sent to a file rather than standard output.
Minimal IP Monitor monitors the Internet connection and switches it off and on again if noticed to be dead.
Minimal IP Monitor from Startup does the same, but output is sent to a file rather than standard output.
ip_address.php is a PHP script to be deployed in a public Internet address so the four BASH scripts can access it.
